def crypt_private(passwd, passwd_hash, hash_prefix='$P$'):
    ''' Hash password, using same salt and number of
        iterations as in passwd_hash.

    This is useful when you want to check password match.
    In this case you pass your raw password and password
    hash to this function and then compare its return
    value with password hash again:

       is_valid = (crypt_private(passwd, hash) == hash)

    hash_prefix is used to check that passwd_hash is of
    supported type. It is compared with first 3 chars of
    passwd_hash and if does not match error is returned.

    NOTE: all arguments must be ASCII strings, not unicode!
    If you want to support unicode passwords, you could
    use any encoding you want. For compatibility with PHP
    it is recommended to use UTF-8:

       passwd_ascii = passwd.encode('utf-8')
	   is_valid = (crypt_private(passwd_ascii, hash) == hash)

	Here hash is already assumed to be an ASCII string.

	In case of error '*0' is usually returned. But if passwd_hash
	begins with '*0', then '*1' is returned to prevent false
	positive results of password check.
