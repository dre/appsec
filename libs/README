Variables to be changed are in the 'vars' dir, the files should be self explanatory based on their respective names. Some files in this directory (such as SocketController) need to reference its respective variables file in the 'vars' directory. This is accomplished via the setting of the PYTHONPATH env variable, in some cases it is set at run time in code, other times you need to set it.
