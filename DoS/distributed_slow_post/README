Variables to be changed are in the 'vars' dir, the 2 files you should focus on for the Slow POST DDoS are:

- slow_ddos_tor_vars.py
- socket_controller_vars.py

main.py sets the PYTHONPATH env variable and this is necessary for the stuff in some directories (like 'libs')
to reference stuff in other directories (such as 'vars').

This prog requires the tor executable so it must be present and the full path set in the vars file: 'socket_controller_vars.py'

The Distributed Slow POST DDoS prog will generate attack traffic.
Since tor is used the target will see traffic from all kinds of disparate locations (hence, 'distributed').


Usage:

- modify the variables in the 2 files referenced earlier.

Go to the DoS/distributed_slow_post directory:

python main.py
